# CourseSignUp
Rust Programm: Students sign in Courses / Output in separate for easy handling

Students need to select 3 out of 70 courses for the semester. 

ToDo:
Write a programm that takes the 3 choices and adds all the data (1st name, last Name, class, 3 course selection) of the students. 
Then it should be possible to use this information to create 70 course lists (via excel or similar)
